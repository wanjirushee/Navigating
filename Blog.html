        When we’re stuck in the throes of self-doubt, it’s sometimes hard to believe that 
        there is a way out. You might believe that you’re just not cut out for this, that 
        the voice in your head is never going to quiet down and that this is simply never 
        going to go away.
    <br></br>
    I know you’ll keep going. You’ll continue to perform, prove or please your way out of 
    this. You keep thinking that if you can just keep pushing your boundaries, there will be 
    a day that the inner critic who is giving an ongoing commentary on your life will just
     quiet down. You just need to do or be more and it will stop. The more time goes by, 
     the more you worry that maybe there’s just something fundamentally wrong with you. 
     Surely, one day, people will find out that you’re just a fraud. 
     <br></br>
     But then, it never ends does it?
     <br><br>
     <p>Because you can’t out “do” your inner critic.</p>
     <p>There’s no magical day that comes up that says “right, now you’re done, now you’ve proven
      that you are good enough”. And that’s exactly the problem, you’re trying to “solve” your
       feelings of self-doubt by working even harder. Or for others, the answer to self-doubt 
       is just not trying at all or just to keep postponing, because you know, one day you’ll 
       be ready.
       </p>
      <p>
       The point is that either you’re just working up to exhaustion or you’ve given up on 
       your dreams because you’re too scared to fail. Neither scenario is good, because truly:</br>
     </p>
     <p>
        You deserve to feel good.

        You deserve to do the things that you desire.
        
        You deserve to feel at peace with who you are.
     </p>
     <p>
        How do I find my way back to confidence?
     </p>
     <p>
        Honestly, in the beginning I wasn’t even sure whether it was possible. It seemed like 
        the internet was rife with quotes like these:

        “If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. With 
        confidence, you have won even before you have started. ”
        
        Well, that’s just great isn’t it? Defeated before I’ve even started.
        
        But I soon learned that confidence, just like anything else, can be learned – or rather 
        like I like to say: reclaimed.
        
        I spent considerable time learning about what was necessary to really feel more confident 
        in who I am, what I was capable of and perhaps most importantly, what a life on my terms 
        looked like. Little did I know when I started coaching that the journey I was on personally
        ually be the journey that informed my work the most:
        
        The journey from self-doubt to inner confidence.
        
        While I will be the first to put my hand up and say there are still days when my
         self-doubt shows up, I can honestly say that those are far and few between. Moreover,
         self-doubt I experience doesn’t stop me from doing the things that I want to do. 
         My experience of life has become so much more peaceful and joyful. The relationship that 
         I have with myself (and others) is so much better than before and I feel that I’m living 
         my life versus how I thought I should be living. I continue to uncover more and more layers
          of who I am and what I desire for my life – and I love the sense of novelty and adventure
           that comes with that.
     </p>
     <p>
        Is it all roses?
     </p>
   <p>
    Of course not, just like everyone else, there are challenging days and moments, but the 
    big difference is that I can move through those moments more quickly. Ultimately, I feel 
    like I can handle whatever comes my way: I feel safe with myself and I enjoy my own 
    company. I listen to what I need and I take care of myself. And if challenges do arise, 
    as they inevitably do, I know that I will find a way to tackle those. In short:

    I’ve come home to myself and found a deep sense of belonging within myself.
    
    The road to inner confidence isn’t a straight line from A to Z, it’s layered and 
    complex but so incredibly valuable. It’s a deeply personal journey that is different 
    for everyone, but below are some of the steps that I believe are important elements in
    each of our journeys:
   </p>
     <p>
        Building self-awareness and a deeper connection to yourself
     </p>
     <p>
        I believe we all came into this world confident and bursting at the seams with potential.
         We didn’t run around as small children asking:

        Who do I need to be to belong? Am I getting this right? Am I good enough?
        
        We just simply were. Period. Nothing we needed to be do or do until the messaging about 
        who we thought we needed to be from our parents, communities and societies started to be
         layered on top.
        
        The better you become at adapting yourself to others, the more you can get removed
         from who you are. As such, it becomes incredibly important to get to know yourself again 
         and really build a sense of self again:

     <p>
        What do I want?
     </p>
     <p>
        Developing this stronger set of self is key. If we don’t truly know ourselves, then 
        how we can design a life that is authentically ours?

        The work then isn’t really to do anything different, but rather to connect more deeply to
          your 
          to understand who you are, what you stand for and what matters most to you.

          The work is to be so deeply rooted in yourself that no matter what the winds of change bring, 
           there is a core of stability within you and you are guided by your own inner voice.
           The better you know yourself, the easier it becomes to make decisions that are aligned with 
          who you are and how you want to show up in this world.
     </p>
     <p>
    Healing the wounds within
     </p>   
     <p>
        A critical piece of the work is to understand what prevents you from feeling like you’re
         good enough to begin with – and to bring healing to some of those stories. This is deep 
         work, but an essential part of reclaiming your confidence. If you don’t heal the wounds 
         that lead you to believe that you aren’t good enough to begin with, no mindset work, 
         goal-setting and action planning is going to cut it in the long-run. It’s like putting 
         on a band-aid, but you never really heal the wounds underneath.

        This doesn’t have to mean years of psycho-analysis and digging at all, but having an 
        understanding of why we behave in the way that we do offers a pathway of change:
        
        only when you can see your behavioural patterns and why you engage in this way, then can 
        you truly making lasting transformations.

            Self-care and self-compassion practices
         </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
        Another important element of making the journey to inner confidence is to understand 
        how you can treat yourself with more compassion and care so that you can flourish.

        Just like a plant, the more you water yourself with love and compassion, the firmer t
        he roots will take hold and the stronger you will grow.
        
        This work is really about prioritising the relationship you have with yourself and 
        putting yourself at the centre of your life. This is also generally what many of the 
        clients I work with struggle the most, because they’ve taught themselves that to do 
        so is selfish.
        
        One of the most important mindset shifts you can make is to understand that you are 
        deserving of the same love and care you give to others AND that your self-care serves 
        others. You can’t support others if you are running on empty.
        
        To prioritise the relationship you have with yourself means to live from the inside
         out, i.e. making conscious choices of how you want to show up to the world and what 
         you need for you to be the best version of yourself. Being kind and caring towards 
         yourself essentially means that you create a space of safety and security for your 
         authentic self to show up with more courage so that you can move into action, 
         learning and growth – confidence’s kryptonite.
