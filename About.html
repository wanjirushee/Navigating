    <h1>The youth taking up the front row</h1> 
     <p>It is often said that the  youth are the back born of any generation.
        All the facts pointing to the fact that its indeed true,measures and 
        quick actions must be taken to keep our kenyan youth occupied with 
        tasks that will keep them away from any negative thoughts that often 
        lead them to crime.
        They look upon to the role models in the community for advice and motivation.
        If at all they lack someone to mimic they end up losing themselves in all
        manner of crimes and bad habits.
    </p>
    <p>There are alot of community service out there where voluntering opportunities
            are needed.Some of them include;
            <em>Community rehabilitation centers.</em>
            Most tenagers out here have become drug addicts who need people to
            guide them and help them overcome the addiction.
            <em>Street families</em>
            <p>The number of  families breaking up in Kenya due to domestic violence
                increases everyday.This pushes the children involved to elope from 
                their homes and later on end up homeless.They are then forced to use any
                means possible to survive even if it means killing! With people to support and mentor 
                them,they would change for the betterand actually be productive in the society.

 <p>In elderly homes alot of assistance is required to help them manage even the simplest of tasks.
     They require personal assistance to keep up with their daily life.The youths can volunteer 
     in keeping them busy by telling them stories,taking them for strolls,playing with them simple games 
     like bingo etc.

<h2>The after math of colonialism</h2>
<p>For the longest time the effects of colonialism have and will forever play a very
    crucial part in everyone's life.They left structures that are till date 
    a part of us.Some would argue that colonialism brought nothing but pain and sorrow
    to the natives,but then, there are positive effects that came about.Yes! so many leaders
    and citizens lost their lives but it was and still isn't  in vein.
    
</p>
<p><em>"The world will never be fair"</em>It will always throw you thorns and stones but then
    it is upon you to use/see them as motivation to focus and never give up in life.
    Our well reknown leaders back then  used the little they had to fight colonialism.
   smh I mean,they had all the reasons to give excuses as to why they stood no chance of fighting
  for independence but they did not.Instead they fought head on.They rolled up their sleeves and
  got the job done.

  Both men and women were made to work for little or no pay at all in the large plantation and mining
  cites.They were given little or no food at all.They were mostly squatters who had no other option
  since they were homeless.

  <p>Referencing the book <em>Born a crime</em> Trevor was born at a time when apartheid in South Africa
    was at its pick.Racism and colorism was filled in the air.People of mixed colors were not allowed to
    mix,one was only to relate with one of the same color.But Trevor's mother,never obliged to that.
    She got into a relationship with a white man and bore Trevor.He therefore was colored! This was actually 
    a crime and was punishable by death.That was the situation in south Africa.
</p>
<div id="trevor" >
<img src = "./images/Trevor.jpeg" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Trevor's mother redefined the odds and made herself new ones to the taste of her liking.She brought up
    Trevor as a diverse person who was free from any social class preference ,skin color and religious
    denominations.That is what is called freedom <em>freeing your mind and just being open to
    new ideas</em>
</p>
<p>Having mention the above you and I can amicably agree that there is always a silver lining in every rcloud.
       Since colonialism there have been some major developments in some structures that were laid out during That
       period.They include;
     <br> </br> 
       <em>Education</em>
    
  Unlike in the past,currently education is taken upon seriously irregadless of whether male or female.
  Parents too have taken up the responsibility of sending their children to school.The Government on the other hand 
  has also subsidised school fees making it alot easier to access education.Burseries and HELB loans have also
  come in handy to needy children who desire to continue with their studies but cant pay upfront.
</p>

    </div>
<p><em>Infrastructure</em>
    plays a very major role in the economic growth and development of a country.
    Kenya for one has invested alot in this sector and the effects are fruitful.Currently Kenya is among
    the fastest growing economies in Africa.Modern highways have been built smothening the distribution
    of goods from manufactures to the ene users.Railway lines have also been built and this has translated to
    availing job opportunities to the youths hence reducing unemployment cases.
</p>

<p> Some structures though are not really growing or implemented in the right way and therefore
    they are slowly being infamous so to speak.Democracy nowadays is only for the majority who
    have connections and the resources to manipulate situations inorder to get what they want.
    Money laundry has become so common in Kenya that it no longer seems like a big issue.
</p>
<p> Gender equality has also been neglected leaving the male gender to dominate and take up all
    the high positions in any company or organisation.It has been a misconception from way back that 
    <em>boys are better than girls</em> .This mentality has gone ahead and is almost becoming a reality.
    Girls are taking the back seats leaving the front ones to be occupied by men.If I'm being honest I 
    this whole misconception is as a result of "reverse psychology".I mean,girls have been feed that information
    since childhood and has been part of who they are and have grown to believe.

         <h3>Thinking beyond our imagination</h3>
         <p>Often are times when we feel low and insignificant in life to the point of loosing 
         ourselves value and importance.Its beyond our control but we can definately do something 
         to change that and not just wallow ourselves with sollow.

         "There are many ways to kill a cat" just like the saying,its absolutely true.If you find yourself challenged
         with something seek for alternative solutions and I promise  you will find what you are looking for.
         There is more to life and the sooner you realise this the better.
         </p>
         <div id ="imagine".>
             <img src="./images/imagine.jpeg" alt=""/>
             </div>
         <p>Creativity is natured and can grow to extream lengths that are unimaginable.In the book <em>"Man's search for meaning"</em>
            Frankl always found a reason to smile and hope for a better tommorow.His wife and kids were his source of strength.His imagination was
            so strong that he even drew strength from nature! Yeah I know what you are thinking "That guy was crazy" but no,what he had
            was willingness to see life with a positive view despite his situation.
            
         <p> Reading books has been proven to be a very helpful way of naturing your Creativity and improving
             ones imagination capabilities.It also improves ones vocabulary and fluency while speaking.Listening to
             other people's problems also comes in handy too.It gives you momentum to keep pushing and facing your
             challenges rather than running away from them.
         </p>
         <p> Arts and craft gives someone the luxury of being themselves in a way that they can express who they are,
             what they feel,how they view the world and its environment and most importantly,how they wish the world would be.
             The choice of color used can communicate alot .It's the mood that it brings that communicates the same.
             The mental state of the artist also plays a major role in this.
       </p>
       <p>Song composition and poetry writing are probably the most common ways of being creative.Music is consumed
           everyday whether intentional or not.People actually find solace in music lyrics.They draw motivation from music 
           and actualy convey information ie advice,government affairs,gospel messages etc.The music industry here in Kenya 
           congested because there is demand for the same. 
         </p>
         <p> Today grafitti has also been on the rise.The youths are using their talent to actually make a lively hood 
             out of it.It is every where,on buses,public walls,shoes,clothes and even on billboards.They prefer working rather than
             stealing and venturing into crime.
             <p>All the above has been my incites on the given content on application with the knowledge 
                 gained in class and other external sources.Thank you for your time to view my site.As always,
                <b>stay safe and be wise.</b>
